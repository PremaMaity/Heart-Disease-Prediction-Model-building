# Heart-Disease-Prediction-Model-building
Heart Disease prediction weather the person has heart disease depending on 14 features

###  Heart disease prediction using ML(Logistic Regression ,KNN ,NaÃ¯ve Bayes, Decision Tree, SVM, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) on single data set to get the best possible accuracy and comparing all. 
#Data insight: As mentioned here we will be working with the heart disease detection dataset and we will be putting out interesting inferences from the data to derive some meaningful results.

#EDA: Exploratory data analysis is the key step for getting meaningful results.
#Feature engineering: After getting the insights from the data we have to alter the features so that they can move forward for the model building phase.
#Model building: In this phase, we will be building our Machine learning model for heart disease detection.

It hads 14 features:
#age
#sex : 1=,male 0=female
#chest pain type (4 values)
#resting blood pressure
#serum cholestoral in mg/dl
#fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl
#resting electrocardiographic results (values 0,1,2)
#maximum heart rate achieved
#exercise induced angina
#oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
#the slope of the peak exercise ST segment
#number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy
#thal: 0 = normal; 1 = fixed defect; 2 = reversable defect
